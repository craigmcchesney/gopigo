This repo contains python related to the gopigo robot car.  I used this to
teach python to some high school students a couple of years ago.

There is currently a single folder "autonomy" that contains two src files,
"autonomy" and "autonomy-cannon.py".  The first is a simple autonomous
navigation program that moves the car around while trying to avoid obstacles.
The second adds to that a usb-controlled nerf cannon, so that when an
obstacle is encountered the cannon fires a missile before navigating away.

The files need to be installed on the gopigo (raspberry pi platform) and run
on the car using python, by logging in remotely to it in order to start the
program.

See https://www.dexterindustries.com/gopigo2-tutorials-documentation/ for more
details.
